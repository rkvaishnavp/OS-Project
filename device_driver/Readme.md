# Implementing a Device Driver

## batt_to_bright
Here we implemented a device driver which checks if the battery <br />is charging or not if it is charging then set brightness to <br />100% else if not charging then set the brightness according<br /> to the battery percentage

## sound_to_bright
Here we implemented a device driver which gets input from <br />microphone and based the decibel level we will change the <br />brightness accordingly
